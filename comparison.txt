The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.
Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.
Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.
Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.
The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.
Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.
However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.
"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten," she said.
"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.
"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?"
Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.
Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.
Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.
The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.
He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.
"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done," he said.
"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses."
He said it was important that "immediate steps" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.
As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.
One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.
The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.
Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.
Police have appealed for information about the attack.
Insp David Gibson said: "It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.
"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately."

Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.
Sebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.
The world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.
But stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said "no clear instruction was given on where he should park".
Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.
Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer "did a good job and I didn't".
Mercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.
After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.
But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.
Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.
The gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.
Vettel said: "Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time."
Vandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.
The Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.
He also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.
Button was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.
The 24-year-old said: "I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.
"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying."
Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: "Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was."
The controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.
FIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he "felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance", adding: "We live in a world where there is too much over reaction."
The system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.
But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.
Only one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.
The teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.
Todt said he was "optimistic" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.
"We should listen to the people watching on TV," Rosberg said. "If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it."
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.
Ricciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.
German Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.

Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation.
Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders.
The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems.
Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation.
Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered.
However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority.
Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was "chronic".
"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere," he said.
"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months.
"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice."
Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem.
"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds," he said.
Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales.
Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released.
He said he would ask himself: "Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter."
"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing."
Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.
"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere," he said.
Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.
"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision," he said.
"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.
"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen."
A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.
It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.

Canada is the “most European of the non-European countries”, Mark Carney has said during his first overseas trip as prime minister to France and the UK, where he is seeking stronger alliances to deal with Donald Trump’s attacks on his country’s sovereignty and economy.

Without mentioning Trump by name, Carney and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a joint press conference in Paris to show a united stance against what they said were economic and geopolitical crises – a reference to Trump’s trade war and “America first” diplomacy that has left longtime allies scrambling.

“Canada is a unique friend,” Macron said, adding that fair trade was more effective than tariffs. Carney spoke in French and English, and said it was important for Canada to strengthen ties with “reliable allies”.

“I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe work enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined like you to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” he said.

A senior Canadian government official who briefed reporters on Carney’s plane said the purpose of the trip was strengthen partnerships with Canada’s two founding countries. The official said Canada was a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on”.

Carney is deliberately making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada’s early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous, French and British.

He said Canada was fundamentally different from the US and would “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States”.

Bosnia's state-level prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the entity of the Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik and two other officials, accusing them of anti-constitutional conduct.

Bosnia's state-level prosecutors issued arrest warrants on Wednesday for three top Bosnian Serb officials — including the president of the Western Balkan country's Serb-majority entity of the Republika Srpska (RS), Milorad Dodik.

Dodik, who has previously said he does not recognise the country's state-level prosecutor's office, has rejected the warrant's validity and any attempts at his arrest, and said he will not go to Sarajevo for questioning.

"There is no such blow or suffering that I am not ready to endure for the Republika Srpska. Milorad Dodik will carry out his duties and I will never leave the Republika Srpska," the Bosnian Serb leader said in the entity's de facto capital, Banjaluka, on Wednesday.

"If anyone thinks we are cowards, they are sorely mistaken," he added.

In addition to the Bosnian Serb leader, the entity's Prime Minister Radovan Višković and National Assembly Speaker Nenad Stevandić are the other two names on the warrant, with the prosecutor's office charging them for anti-constitutional conduct.

Bosnia's state-level court convicted Dodik in late February of going against the decisions of the country's international peace envoy, Christian Schmidt, which constitutes a criminal act. The verdict is not final, and Dodik can appeal it.

Shortly after, Dodik introduced new laws meant to ban the operation of state-level security and judicial institutions in what comprises about half of the Western Balkan country’s territory. 

The decisions have been temporarily suspended by the state-level Constitutional Court.

In Bosnia, the High Representative acts as the chief arbiter in high-profile disputes and the key figure overseeing the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, signed in 1995 to stop the war in the country. 

The agreement brought about the end of the war between the country's three main ethnic groups — Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats — that began in 1992 during the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, deemed as the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II. 

The peace deal, parts of which act as the country's constitution, split the country into two main administrative units, or entities: the Serb-majority RS and the Bosniak-Croat Federation of BiH (FBiH), partially overseen by an umbrella state-level government. 

Meant to appease the former belligerents, it created a complicated system of checks and balances, said to be the world's most complex democracy. 

Meanwhile, NATO's secretary general on Monday pledged the military alliance's "unwavering" support for Bosnia's territorial integrity, visiting the capital Sarajevo amid one of the most significant political crises roiling the EU membership hopeful since the end of the war.

"Three decades after the Dayton Peace Agreement, I can tell you: NATO remains firmly committed to the stability of this region and to the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina," Rutte said. "We will not allow hard-won peace to be jeopardised."

Rutte called any actions undermining the accord, the constitutional order or national institutions "unacceptable".

"Inflammatory rhetoric and actions are dangerous. They pose a direct threat to Bosnia and Herzegovina's stability and security," the NATO chief added.

The European peacekeeping force in Bosnia, EUFOR, has said it was stepping up the number of its troops in response to the tensions.

"There is always an empire that is trying to take away the freedom of the Hungarians, and right now it is the one in Brussels," Viktor Orban said in a speech on Saturday.

Hungary's prime minister on Saturday vowed to rid his country of those he claims work for the interests of foreign powers, saying his right-wing government will eliminate a global “shadow army” serving the European Union and a “liberal American empire”.

In a public address, which coincided with a national holiday commemorating Hungary’s 1848 revolution against Habsburg rule, Viktor Orbán told a group of several thousand supporters that Hungary in the coming weeks will uproot media outlets and other organisations that have received funding from abroad.

“After today’s festive gathering comes the Easter cleaning. The bugs have overwintered," Orbán said. “We will dismantle the financial machine that has used corrupt dollars to buy politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists. We will eliminate the entire shadow army.”

Orbán, in power since 2010, has used the 15 March celebration in recent years as a podium from which to launch increasingly hostile words against the EU.

"There is always an empire that is trying to take away the freedom of the Hungarians, and right now it is the one in Brussels. Brussels is abusing its power, just as Vienna did in the past. They want to rule over us, just as the governors of the Viennese court did in the past," he claimed.

Hungary and Austria were the two states that formed the Habsburg-led Austro-Hungarian Empire, which ruled significant parts of central, eastern and southeastern Europe between the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Orbán said that one task remained, to defend Hungary against Brussels' attacks. "Brussels" has, he claimed, "jumped headlong into the Russian-Ukrainian war".

"We did not jump into the war with Brussels, the empire does not want to help, but to colonise, the means of this is war, it will cost what it costs, and then Ukraine will gain EU membership."

Orbán said there was only one answer: "European Union, but without Ukraine."

Groups benefitting from USAID funding to 'face consequences'?
Recently, the Hungarian leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets, civil rights and anti-corruption groups, which he says have undermined Hungary's sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.

Orbán, an ally of US President Donald Trump, has applauded the US administration’s actions to dismantle the US Agency for International Development, claiming, with no evidence, that it was used to fund liberal causes in Hungary aimed at toppling his government.

He has promised that groups that have benefited from funding by USAID would be eliminated in Hungary and face “legal consequences”.

This week, Orbán's ruling Fidesz party proposed amendments to Hungary's constitution that would allow Hungarian dual citizens to have their citizenship suspended and be deported from the country if they threaten its sovereignty or national security.

On Saturday, Orbán, a firm opponent of immigration, also echoed the conspiratorial “great replacement theory,” which suggests there is a global plot to diminish the influence of white people.

"The battle today is actually being fought for the soul of the Western world," Orbán said. “The empire wants to mix and then replace the indigenous people of Europe with invading masses arriving from foreign civilizations.”
